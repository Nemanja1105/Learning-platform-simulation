# Learning-platform-simulation

This application represents a simulation of a learning platform that allows users to sign up for courses, exchange messages, and make friends with other users. The platform supports two types of users - students and teachers. Students can sign up for a course and attend it, while teachers are responsible for approving applications and tracking student progress.

The learning platform also supports the functionality of sending friend requests and exchanging messages between users. Students can exchange messages with other students and teachers who are responsible for the courses they attend.

The application allows the administration of users and courses, which means that the system administrator can add, modify or remove users and courses. All changes are persistent, so the system state will be preserved even after closing the application.

In addition, the platform allows the comparison of two courses, finding the union, intersection, and difference between sets of students who attend the course or have passed the exam. It is possible to filter messages in the inbox according to a given search string.

To sign up for a course, a student must meet certain prerequisites, which can be defined in different ways. Possible examples of prerequisites are that the student has taken a course, passed a specified number of courses with some common property, passed specific courses with a minimum grade for each of those courses, or passed at least one course in several different areas.

Finally, it is possible to examine the friendship graph between all persons in the system and determine the shortest path in the friendship graph between any two people, as well as the average shortest path (a real number) between people who meet the selected condition.
